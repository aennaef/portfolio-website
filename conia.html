                    high shares of non-desk workers, and noticing a gap in the market,it was decided to launch the app as its own product. I joined the team just before this pivotal decision, stepping into the role of the product designer.

              <p>
                Middle-sized companies in the production industries often struggle with ineffective employee communication practices, resulting in fragmented information flows, poor collaboration between teams, and a disconnect between
                management and staff, ultimately leading to high fluctuation rates and decreased productivity.

                    Companies need a quick and easy way to share important information with their non-desk employees and simplify complicated, labor-intensive tasks to boost employee motivation and satisfaction and ultimately ensure the
                    productivity of the company.

              <p>
                My first objective after obtaining the newly branded app was to expand the brand's visual language to ensure consistency and appeal. To accomplish this, I began creating onboarding screens that not only introduced users to
                the app's functions, but also developed a consistent visual brand. I experimented with several visual directions, and in total, 36 distinct screens were created.

                  To determine the visual direction, I conducted a preference test between my two favourite sets (n = 27). I found that nearly two-thirds of the participants preferred the variant with gradient bubbles. Based on this result,
                  I proceeded confidently with this direction.

                  In just a few months, we acquired four customers and began receiving app store reviews. Some customers even contacted our product owner with requests for improvements. Building on the foundation laid by previous
                  iterations, I analysed user feedback to identify areas for improvement. By carefully reviewing user insights and pain points, I iteratively refined the existing designs to enhance usability and address user needs.

                    "Request Profile Changes," included an "App Settings" section for language preferences and notifications, and made the logout button prominent and clear.

                <h3>Adhering to an existent design scheme</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-with-border">
                  One of the new challenges for me was working with an already established interface by following its existing design scheme. Whenever I was developing a new feature or wanted to improve the existing design by changing UI
                  elements, I had to search for existing patterns before creating a new element. Initially, this was a difficult task, but with some practice I found ways to reuse patterns while also improving the user experience (e.g. when
                  redesigning the profile section with a tab menu).

                <h3>Balancing functionality and simplicity</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-with-border">
                  Balancing a comprehensive feature set with a clutter-free user experience is challenging within financial and technical constraints. While the initial product had only five different features placed on the home screen,
                  it’s now possible to have placed up to ten features with similar functions on the home screen (e.g. News articles can be posted in the news feature and files can be posted in the document feature with the content also
                  being “news content”). This is not ideal but due to budget limits restructuring of the app’s features and navigation was not possible so far.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>The challenges of product development in an agency</h3>
              <p class="paragraph-with-border">
                Allocating time and resources to product development in the midst of a busy agency schedule with multiple client projects was not always possible, as different team members were involved in multiple projects simultaneously,
                resulting in delays and some features (feedback & chat) not being developed (yet).
