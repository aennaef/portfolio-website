            <h2>From client project to product launch</h2>
            <p>Bytabo© initially collaborated with a medium-sized metal construction company to develop the idea of an employee app. <br>After successfully implementing the project, recognizing common issues in mid-sized companies with high shares of non-desk workers, <br>and noticing a gap in the market,it was decided to launch the app as its own product. <br>I joined the team just before this pivotal decision, stepping into the role of the product designer.</p>

        <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>Due to pre-existing design and development of key app features, the process for implementation in conia couldn't be fully mapped out in the beginnig. <br>Upon receiving the rebranded app, I took the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Understanding the product</li>
            <li>Expanding the brand’s visual language</li>
            <li>Improving old designs based on customer feedback</li>
            <li>Sketching out user flows & wireframes for new features</li>

        <div id="conia-product-understanding"> <!-- Start conia understanding --> 
          <div> <!--Start text--> 
            <h2>Understanding the product</h2>
            <p>Before I started designing, I aimed to understand the product, the users and typical use cases as thoroughly as possible. <br>I therefore started by learning about the background of product development.</p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Middle-sized companies often struggle with ineffective employee communication practices, resulting in fragmented information flows, <br> collaboration between teams, and a disconnect between management and staff, ultimately leading to high fluctuation rates and decreased productivity.  </p>
            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>Companies need a quick and easy way to share important information with their non-desk employees and simplify complicated, <br>labor-intensive tasks to boost employee motivation and satisfaction and ultimately ensure the productivity of the company.</p>
            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <p>A native mobile app, available for iOS and Android, that can be installed on employees' smartphones  and allows company managers <br> to send relevant information to their employees, ensuring they receive important information in a timely manner.</p>

            <h2>Expanding the app’s visual language</h2>
            <p>My first objective after obtaining the newly branded app was to expand the brand's visual language to ensure consistency and appeal. <br>To accomplish this, I began creating onboarding screens that not only introduced users to the app's functions, but also developed a consistent visual brand. brI experimented with several visual directions, and in total, 36 distinct screens were created. </p>

    <h2>My takeaways</h2>
    <h3>Adhering to an existent design scheme</h3>
    <p>One of the new challenges for me was working with an already established interface by following its existing design scheme. <br> Whenever I was developing a new feature or wanted to improve the existing design by changing UI elements, I had to search for existing patterns before creating a new element. <br> Initially, this was a difficult task, but with some practice I found ways to reuse patterns while also improving the user experience (e.g. when redesigning the profile section with a tab menu).</p>
  
    <h3>Balancing functionality and simplicity</h3>
    <p>Balancing a comprehensive feature set with a clutter-free user experience is challenging within financial and technical constraints. <br> While the initial product had only five different features placed on the home screen, it’s now possible to have placed up to ten features with similar functions on the home screen<br>(e.g. News articles can be posted in the news feature and files can be posted in the document feature with the content also being “news content”). This is not ideal but due to budget limits restructuring of the app’s features and navigation was not possible so far.</p>

    <h3>The challenges of product development in an agency</h3>
    <p>Allocating time and resources to product development in the midst of a busy agency schedule with multiple client projects was not always possible, <br> as different team members were involved in multiple projects simultaneously, resulting in delays and some features (feedback & chat) not being developed (yet).</p>
